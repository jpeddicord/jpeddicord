Hello! My name's Jacob and I'm a software dingus.

I'm not terribly active on social media anymore, at least within tech spaces. Much of my not-at-work focus has shifted towards art and the outdoors! I love to draw and paint, hike, ski, and find & make good food.

The best way to reach me is by email or LinkedIn (see sidebar).
